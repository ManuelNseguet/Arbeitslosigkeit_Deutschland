## 📊 Arbeitslosigkeit von Frauen und Männern in Nordbayern

---

## Project Context
This project was created as part of the university module  
**“Data Visualization & Storytelling.”**

The objective is to analyze and visualize gender-specific differences
in unemployment rates in North Bavaria and to communicate these insights
through clear, transparent, and reproducible visualizations.

---

## Research Question
How does unemployment among women and men in North Bavaria differ over time,
and which structural patterns can be identified through data visualization?

---

## Big Idea
Although North Bavaria is considered an economically strong region with
relatively low unemployment rates, noticeable differences between women
and men still exist.

These differences are shaped by regional labor market structures,
sectoral employment, and different life phases.

---

## Data Source
- Source: INKAR (Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development)
- Region: North Bavaria
- Time period: Multiple years
- Variables:
  - Year
  - Gender
  - Unemployment rate

---

## Project Structure
- `data/raw/`  
  Contains the unemployment data in CSV format (German file name, English columns).

- `src/`  
  Python scripts for data loading, processing, and visualization.

- `outputs/`  
  Automatically generated visualizations.

---

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Execution
```bash
python src/main.py
```

All visualizations will be generated automatically and saved in the outputs/ folder.

---

## Results and Visualizations

The project produces three main visualizations:

Comparison of unemployment rates between women and men

Development of the gender gap over time

Overall unemployment trend in North Bavaria

The visualizations are intentionally kept simple to ensure clarity,
readability, and an honest representation of the data.

---

## Interpretation and Storytelling

The results show that gender-specific differences in unemployment persist
even in economically strong regions.

While aggregated indicators often suggest a positive labor market situation,
a more detailed view reveals the influence of structural factors such as
employment sectors, work-life balance, and regional conditions.

These insights form the foundation for the storytelling approach used in the
presentation, where the data is contextualized and explained through
illustrative examples.
